The biggest advantage of taking an online course is the flexibility it provides, making scheduling for other classes easier. There is no restriction for when and where you study and could be very beneficial for off campus students. Rather than sitting in a classroom, you can study in the comfort of your own home or even during downtime if you hold a job.

Each professor has their own teaching method, but an online course means the student has their own choice of how they want to learn the content. It typically contains videos, audio content, and reading content that you can review at any time allowing you to digest information that suits your learning style. This also makes it easier to catch up should any confusion comes up.
