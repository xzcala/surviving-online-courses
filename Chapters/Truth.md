# The Truth

## :+1: Meaningful Interactions

Online courses follow the same curriculum and are still taught by the same professors who would otherwise teach the content in a lecture. They also provide opportunities for students to reach for help either in person, or most likely, a virtual office hour.  The sessions are an excellent way to ask questions, seek clarification, connect with the instructor, and gain lifelong skills.


## :thought_balloon: Learning environment

Online courses are not for everybody as some thrive in a traditional setting such as those who prefer to participate in class. However, those who are able and willing to take control of their own learning and like to work at their own pace will benefit greatly from taking an online class. For those who like both, some online courses offer students to take part of an in-seat lecture if there are spots in the class. Before registering to an online course, keep in mind of the best learning environment suited for you.
