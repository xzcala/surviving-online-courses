# Avoiding pitfalls

## :clock10: Plan ahead

Online courses typically consist of modules, laying out the course content on a per-week basis. A good habit to have surviving the semester is to know exactly when everything is due. New students should start incorporating good time management practices such as marking due dates on a calendar and establishing a working pattern.

## :books: Material

Being able to solve problems by yourself is a great skill to have for surviving online courses. Like any forms of learning, the content being provided is not concrete especially in the IT realm where technology is constantly changing. Both the internet and our library are great sources for learning relevant information and is highly recommended to help understand concepts stronger but also seeing the bigger picture.

## :eyes: Staying focused

While there are many sources of information available, it could be easy to get lost. It is important to focus on a topic and solving specific problems related to instead searching for as many sources as possible. To avoid getting lost, set specific goals to solve problems relevant to the topic and then commit time to study a few resources to achieve it. By doing so, you will learn to deliver desirable work regardless of time constraints. 

## :wave: Support

Each online course has an instructor that may also have teaching assistants available to help the students. The information to contact these people are always found on the syllabus provided at the beginning of the semester. Saving a bookmark or saving it to your local drive is a good way to reference this information.
