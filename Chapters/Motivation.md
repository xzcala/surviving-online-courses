# Staying Motivated

## :laughing: Positivity

Having a positive attitude before starting anything is important. Some common doubts to have are trying something new and thinking about what may go wrong or not being capable of solving problems alone. The best way to go around it is to not allow it to dominate your thinking process and focus on what you know so far and more importantly, what you can learn. There is always a start to something, and as a student there is never a level where you can end, so the gradual process of learning should be something to be celebrated.

An adequate school-work-life balance is important to keep in mind when signing up for an online course. Particularly for college students, letting yourself be overwhelmed will most likely lead to losing sight of goals. Taking breaks periodically and relaxing will help alleviate chances of burn out. As a Mizzou student, several resources are available both online and in campus to help create a balanced schedule, learn ways to relax, and places to socialize. 

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Progress

Reflecting on progress can lead to increased motivation, it lets students appreciate how far they have come and all they have learned. Whether things are going well or not, having a retrospective provides students a way to see what is working well, what needs to change, what they have learned, and what to expect in the following week. This is best done weekly and is highly advisable to keep in a routine. Fortunately, this class includes a “Retrospective” section aimed to help students stay in track.
