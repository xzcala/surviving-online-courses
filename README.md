## About

Online courses could be as difficult, if not more difficult, than lecture classes. While you donâ€™t have to be on campus to take the course, it typically requires more reading as well a good sense of self-direction. This means that even the greatness of flexibility itself can lead to tight situations or some you cannot recover fromg at all. This guide will describe how to avoid such pitfalls and provide ways to feel more motivated throughout the class. 

## Who it's for

This guide is for fellow students picking up an online course as well as ones already registered in it. It is not specific to any course, as all online courses pose the same kinds of problems to most students. There are some misconceptions about online courses but knowing how to deal with the tradeoffs will not only help you succeed in an online class, it will provide skills such as time management, goal oriented, and self-driven.
