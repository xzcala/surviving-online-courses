## :memo: Is online easier than in-seat?

The content being taught in an online course is the exact same as it would be in a lecture class. Having the same workload as a student in seat, the difficulty will depend on one’s ability to learn the content independently without the option to ask for help immediately. While this may be easy for some, the lack of face-to-face interaction limits any additional help and could be detrimental. 


## :memo: Does it save time?

The biggest promise of an online course is the flexibility it provides. Not having to walk to class or sit down for a whole lecture means more time to work on the content, which means the time spent studying for the course all depends on one’s own learning experience and strategies. When a question needs to be asked or a concept needs to be explained further, you would need to either seek help in person or wait for an e-mail response leading to time loss that can often cause a burnout.
